# python-air

This is an *experimental* front-end for Python analysis in Rascal. It uses the Python `ast` library to create abstract
syntax trees for Python source files or Python code snippets, and maps those to a convenient `data` type in Rascal.

We use [issues](https://github.com/cwi-swat/python-air/issues) as our TODO list for this project.
